Her original sample can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/mkpythonanywhereblog/d1fb3dca2e66146f519f) 

NB! This project uses a simple approach for tests: it just calls Selenide standard `$` method to find elements in mobile app.
I like it. It's just good enough.

But if you want to use Android- and IOS- specific annotations like `@AndroidFindBy`, consider using library [selenide-appium](https://github.com/selenide/selenide-appium). It has Selenide+Appium specific page factory for supporting those annotations.
